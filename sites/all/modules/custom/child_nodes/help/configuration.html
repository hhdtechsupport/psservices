<p>The "Parent type" is a content type which can have another type produced from it, with information flowing down the family tree.</p>

<p>The "Child type" is the content type that can be created off the parent type.</p>

<p>Any "Parent type" content will have a button placed on it to create a child type from it. When that button is clicked, a child item will be created and the information specified on the "Fields" page will be propagated.</p>
